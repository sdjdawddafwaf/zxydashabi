                <p>I am cheerful, stable and energetic, treat people warmly. Meticulous about study, like to discuss
                    problems with classmates, research problems. In life, I pay attention to physical exercise, often go
                    to play basketball with my classmates, and go to the school gym three times a week to strengthen
                    training. I firmly believe that the body is the capital of the revolution, and only by ensuring a
                    strong body can we better complete our studies. I'm equally enthusiastic about socializing. I like
                    to make a variety of friends, because I think it not only expands my knowledge, but also allows me
                    to recognize my own shortcomings. Sincerely welcome everyone to make friends with me.
